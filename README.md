# Muhammad Adeel Iqbal — Premium WordPress Portfolio

A premium Next.js portfolio for Muhammad Adeel Iqbal, redesigned with a Digitalists-inspired layout and interaction direction while keeping Adeel's own visual identity: iCloud-style soft gradients, orange/black/cream color system, glassmorphism cards, system UI typography, rounded buttons, project content, screenshots, and contact details.

## What changed

- Floating pill header with glass blur, light/dark mode toggle, search overlay, Start button, and full-screen animated menu
- Orange preloader, top scroll progress, Lenis smooth scrolling, GSAP + ScrollTrigger reveals, and scrubbed project container-scroll motion
- Rebuilt editorial hero with project mockup, floating labels, clean copy hierarchy, and mobile-safe wrapping
- Premium services section with sticky sidebar, 50+ Projects metric, and glass service cards
- Aceternity/21st.dev-style project container-scroll showcase: screenshots rotate in 3D, scale, and settle on scroll with clear CTAs
- Digitalists-style project index with hover previews
- Polished process, about, and contact sections
- Persistent light/dark mode using `localStorage`, with system-theme fallback on first visit
- Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- GitHub Pages static export support with `/Portfolio` basePath via the existing workflow

## System font update

The site now uses the browser/system UI font stack shown in DevTools instead of loading Inter from Google Fonts. This keeps the portfolio faster, cleaner, and closer to the default Tailwind-style `font-sans` rendering.
